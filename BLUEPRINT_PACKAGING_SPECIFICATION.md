# Blueprint Packaging Specification v2.0

## Overview

The Ultimate Blueprint Pilot now enforces logic manifest consumption as the authoritative source of truth for all future builds. This specification ensures that all code generation is traceable, modular, and manifest-locked.

## Logic Manifest Requirements

### Core Specification

```yaml
logic_manifest_required: true
logic_manifest_spec:
  required_fields:
    - master_file_strategy
    - table_merge_plan

    - sustainment_plan
    - audit_map
    - build_agent
    - manifest_version
```

### Required Fields Definition

#### 1. master_file_strategy

      - not_null
      - valid_manifest
```

#### 4. agent_interaction
Defines allowed patterns and forbidden operations:
```yaml
agent_interaction:
  allowed_patterns:
    - blueprint_generation
    - code_generation
    - manifest_validation
  forbidden_operations:
    - freelancing
    - manifest_modification
    - scope_violation
  interaction_scope: "manifest_defined_only"
```

#### 5. cursor_scope
Specifies template usage and code generation rules:
```yaml
cursor_scope:
  template_usage:
    - react_component
    - api_endpoint
    - database_schema
  code_generation_rules:
    - follow_manifest
    - use_templates
    - validate_output
  modification_limits:
    - no_manifest_changes
    - no_scope_expansion
    - no_freelancing
```

#### 6. sustainment_plan
Defines health checks, monitoring hooks, and failure handlers:
```yaml
sustainment_plan:
  health_checks:
    - manifest_validation_hook
    - blueprint_health_check
  monitoring_hooks:
    - generation_monitor
    - error_tracker
  failure_handlers:
    - error_handler
    - rollback_handler
```

#### 7. audit_map
Specifies required audits, fields, and retention policies:
```yaml
audit_map:
  required_audits:
    - blueprint_generation_audit
    - manifest_access_audit
  audit_fields:
    generation:
      - user_id
      - blueprint_id
      - generation_time
      - manifest_version
    access:
      - user_id
      - manifest_id
      - access_time
      - operation
  retention_policies:
    generation_audits: "7 years"
    access_audits: "3 years"
    system_audits: "1 year"
```

#### 8. build_agent
Identifies the build agent for traceability:
```yaml
build_agent: "Cursor AI Assistant"
```

#### 9. manifest_version
Tracks manifest version for compatibility:
```yaml
manifest_version: "1.0.0"
```

## Enforcement Rules

### 1. No Build Approval Without Manifest
- All builds must validate and consume the embedded logic manifest
- Build validation fails if logic manifest is missing or invalid
- No exceptions permitted for manifest consumption

### 2. No Code Generation Beyond Scope
- No modifications permitted beyond manifest specifications
- All code must follow manifest-defined patterns
- Freelancing is explicitly forbidden

### 3. Manifest Embedding Required
- All build artifacts must include the embedded manifest
- Manifest must be in appropriate format for file type
- Manifest extraction and validation must be possible

### 4. Agent Interaction Limits
- All agents (Cursor, Claude, etc.) must follow manifest-defined patterns
- Interaction scope is limited to "manifest_defined_only"
- Forbidden operations are strictly enforced

### 5. Audit Trail Mandatory
- All generation activities must be logged according to audit requirements
- Audit fields must include manifest version and build agent
- Retention policies must be followed

## Validation Process

### Build-Time Validation
1. **Manifest Presence Check**: Verify logic manifest is embedded
2. **Required Fields Validation**: Ensure all 9 required fields are present
3. **Field Content Validation**: Validate field content meets specifications
4. **Agent Interaction Validation**: Verify interaction scope and forbidden operations
5. **Audit Compliance Check**: Ensure audit requirements are met

### Runtime Validation
1. **Manifest Extraction**: Extract manifest from build artifacts
2. **Version Compatibility**: Check manifest version compatibility
3. **Pattern Compliance**: Verify code follows manifest patterns
4. **Scope Enforcement**: Ensure no operations beyond manifest scope

## Safe Build Handoff

The logic manifest ensures:

### Traceability
- All builds are traceable to their manifest source
- Build agent and version are recorded
- Generation time and manifest version are tracked

### Portability
- Builds can be safely transferred between agents
- Manifest provides complete build specification
- No agent-specific dependencies

### Cross-Agent Compatibility
- Consistent behavior across different AI agents
- Standardized interaction patterns
- Unified validation rules

### Manifest-Locked Design
- No deviation from specified design patterns
- Enforced scope limitations
- Predictable build outcomes

## Implementation

### Blueprint Packager Module
The `FinalBlueprintPackagerModule` now includes:
- Logic manifest specification generation
- Manifest validation during packaging
- UI display of manifest requirements
- Validation status reporting

### Validation Functions
- `validateLogicManifestSpec()`: Validates manifest specification
- `generateLogicManifestSpec()`: Generates default manifest specification
- Integration with existing build manifest validation

### Sample Output
See `blueprints/final_blueprint_v1.0.0_with_logic_manifest.yaml` for a complete example of a blueprint with embedded logic manifest requirements.

## Compliance

- **No Build Without Manifest**: All builds require valid logic manifest
- **No Freelancing**: All code generation must follow manifest specifications
- **No Scope Violation**: No operations beyond manifest-defined scope
- **Audit Trail**: All activities must be logged according to audit requirements
- **Version Tracking**: All builds must include manifest version and build agent

This specification ensures that the Ultimate Blueprint Pilot produces builds that are safe, portable, and manifest-locked for cross-agent handoff.
